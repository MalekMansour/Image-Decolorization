# Decolorization of Images with Python

## Goal
The goal of this Python script (`decolorization.py`) is to turn a colored image into a colorless (grayscale) image.

## Why
There are situations where individuals may want to print and color certain pictures but find it challenging to locate a blank picture that suits their needs. By employing machine learning technology, we can facilitate this process by transforming a colored image into a colorless one, providing a blank canvas for coloring.
